Boolean Algebra isn’t just about combining 0s and 1s — it’s about doing it efficiently. As logical expressions grow 
more complex, having a toolkit of proven rules helps you break them down, transform them, and simplify them without 
changing their meaning. These rules — known as the **laws and properties of Boolean Algebra** — are the foundation of 
logical reasoning and system optimization. Whether you're designing a logic circuit or writing conditional logic in 
code, understanding these laws will make your logic cleaner, faster, and easier to manage.

## Introduction

In Boolean Algebra, just like in arithmetic, there are specific **laws** and **properties** that govern how values behave and 
interact. These laws allow you to **restructure**, **simplify**, and **analyze** expressions while preserving their logical 
meaning. They’re essential not only for academic exercises but also for practical applications like minimizing the 
number of gates in a digital circuit or optimizing conditions in a software program.

In this lesson, we’ll walk through the most important boolean laws — from basic identity rules to powerful 
simplification techniques. You’ll see how they work symbolically, how they can be applied in real-world logic, and 
how to use them to transform expressions into simpler or more efficient forms. Mastering these laws is a crucial step 
toward becoming fluent in boolean reasoning.

## Identity and Null Laws

The **Identity** and **Null** laws are two of the most basic properties in Boolean Algebra. They define how logical values 
behave when combined with constants — `0` (false) and `1` (true). Understanding these laws is crucial for recognizing 
when parts of an expression can be **eliminated** or **left unchanged**.

### Identity Laws

These laws describe what happens when you combine a variable with a neutral element — in this case, `0` for OR, and `1` 
for AND.

* **A + 0 = A** → OR-ing something to doesn't change it
* **A · 1 = A** → AND-ing something with 1 also doesn’t change it

**Examples:**

* `x OR 0` is just `x`
* `y AND 1` is still `y`

These laws help **keep expressions clean** — you don’t need to include unnecessary constants that don’t affect the 
outcome.

### Null Laws

The Null Laws (sometimes called "Dominance Laws") describe what happens when an input is combined with a value that 
**overrides** it.

* **A + 1 = 1** → OR with 1 is always 1
* **A · 0 = 0** → AND with 0 is always 0

**Examples:**

* `alarmTriggered OR 1` → Always 1 (alarm is active no matter what)
* `isLoggedIn AND 0` → Always 0 (access is denied no matter the login status)

These laws help identify conditions that make the entire expression **always true or always false**, which is 
especially useful when testing or debugging logic.

## Idempotent and Inverse Laws

When simplifying logical expressions, it’s common to encounter repeated variables or combinations of a 
variable with its opposite. The **Idempotent** and **Inverse** laws allow you to deal with these situations 
quickly and accurately.

### Idempotent Laws

The word *idempotent* means "doesn’t change when repeated." In Boolean logic, repeating the same operation with the 
same value has **no additional effect**.

* **A + A = A** → OR-ing a value with itself changes nothing
* **A · A = A** → AND-ing a value with itself also changes nothing

**Examples:**

* `isOnline OR isOnline` is just `isOnline`
* `motionDetected AND motionDetected` is still just `motionDetected`

This law helps eliminate **duplicate conditions** from expressions — a useful trick when cleaning up Boolean code 
or simplifying circuit logic.

### Inverse Laws

Inverse laws tell us what happens when a variable is combined with its **logical opposite** (its **complement**). 
These are particularly important for **detecting contradictions** or **guaranteed truths**.

* **A + ¬A = 1** → A variable OR its opposite is always true
* **A · ¬A = 0** → A variable AND its opposite is always false

**Examples:**

* `doorOpen OR NOT doorOpen` is always `1` — it covers every possibility
* `validInput AND NOT validInput` is always `0` — it’s a contradiction

## Commutative and Associative Laws

In Boolean Algebra, the **order** and **grouping** of terms don’t always matter. These two properties — **Commutative**
and **Associative Laws** — allow you to **rearrange expressions** freely, which is extremely useful for comparison, 
simplification, and standardization of logic.

### Commutative Laws

The **Commutative Law** states that the order of operands does not affect the result for **AND** or **OR** operations.

* **A + B = B + A**
* **A · B = B · A**

This means you can rearrange terms without changing the outcome — helpful for matching patterns or organizing 
expressions neatly.

### Associative Laws

The **Associative Law** lets you regroup variables when using the same operation — AND or OR — across multiple terms. 
The grouping (parentheses) doesn’t matter.

* **(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)**
* **(A · B) · C = A · (B · C)**

This property becomes especially valuable when dealing with longer expressions, as it gives you the freedom to 
group terms in the way that makes simplification easiest.

## Distributive Laws

In Boolean Algebra, just like in regular algebra, the **Distributive Laws** let you **distribute** one operation 
over another. These laws are essential when **rewriting** expressions and building more structured or minimized logic.

There are **two forms** of the Distributive Law:

1. AND over OR

This is the **most common** and useful form:

`A · (B + C) = A·B + A·C`

**Example:**

`isEnabled AND (isAdmin OR isModerator)` can be rewritten as `(isEnabled AND isAdmin) OR (isEnabled AND isModerator)`.

2. OR over AND

This version is less intuitive but equally valid:

`A + (B · C) = (A + B) · (A + C)`

**Example:**

`emergencyOverride OR (systemReady AND doorClosed)` can be rewritten as: `(emergencyOverride OR systemReady) AND (emergencyOverride OR doorClosed)`.

This helps when you need to **factor** logic or convert into canonical forms like **POS** (Product of Sums).

## Absorption Law

As Boolean expressions grow in size, they often contain parts that can be **safely removed** without changing the 
overall behavior. The **Absorption** Law identifies and removes such parts, allowing you to 
**simplify logic** and optimize both expressions and circuits.

There are two key forms:

1. **A + (A · B) = A**
    * If `A` is already true, the extra `(A AND B)` is irrelevant.
2. **A · (A + B) = A**
    * If `A` is false, `A AND anything` is still false — `B` doesn’t matter.

## Key Takeaways

* **Identity Laws**: `A + 0 = A`, `A · 1 = A` (no effect)
* **Null Laws**: `A + 1 = 1`, `A · 0 = 0` (dominant values)
* **Idempotent Laws**: `A + A = A`, `A · A = A` (repetition doesn't change logic)
* **Inverse Laws**: `A + ¬A = 1`, `A · ¬A = 0` (always true/false)
* **Commutative Laws**: Order doesn't matter → `A + B = B + A`
* **Associative Laws**: Grouping doesn’t matter → `(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)`
* **Distributive Laws**: Expand/factor expressions → `A · (B + C) = A·B + A·C`
* **Absorption Laws**: Eliminate unnecessary logic → `A + (A·B) = A`
