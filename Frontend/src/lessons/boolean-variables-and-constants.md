Before we can build complex logic expressions or design digital circuits, we need to understand the fundamental parts 
they’re made of. In Boolean Algebra, these building blocks are **constants** and **variables** — simple elements that 
represent truth values and changeable conditions. Just as regular algebra works with numbers and symbols, boolean algebra
operates with true/false values and symbols that represent them. This lesson will guide you through these essential
components and help you recognize how they appear in everyday logic and computation.

## Introduction 

In boolean logic, everything we work with boils down to two states: **true** or **false**. These two values form the 
basis of all boolean operations, and they are represented using **constants** (fixed values) and **variables** 
(changeable placeholders). Boolean constants are the unchanging “atoms” of logic — they’re always true or false — while 
boolean variables can shift between these two values depending on the situation.

Think of it like flipping a light switch. The states ON and OFF represent boolean constants. But whether the light is 
currently on or off depends on the switch — that's your variable. When designing logic-based systems (like apps, security 
systems, or control panels), you'll often describe how outputs depend on combinations of such variable conditions. 
Understanding how constants and variables behave is key to writing correct and efficient logic expressions.

## Boolean Constants

In Boolean Algebra, **constants** are the simplest elements — they represent fixed, unchanging truth values. In boolean 
logic there are only two boolean constants:

* 1 – Represents **True**
* 0 – Represents **False**

These constants are universal and form the foundation of all logical expressions. Unlike variables, which can change 
value depending on context, **constants never change**. When you use 1 or 0 in a boolean expression, you’re explicitly 
stating that part of the logic is _always true_ or _always false_.

### Why Are Constants Important?

Even though they’re simple, boolean constants play a crucial role in logic simplification and design. They are often used in:

* **Default values**: For example, a system might be “off” by default (`0`) and only turn on when certain conditions are met.

* **Identity laws**: For example, `A AND 1 = A` and `A OR 0 = A`, which are used in simplifying expressions.

* **Fixed inputs in circuits**: In a hardware circuit, a line tied permanently to `1` (a constant voltage) or 
`0` (ground) represents a Boolean constant in the physical world.

### Example

Here’s a very simple boolean expression using constants:

`Alarm = 0`

This tells us the alarm is always off — no matter what other variables exist, this system is hardcoded to never trigger. On the other hand:

`Alarm = 1`

This means the alarm is always active — no logic or condition affects it.

While this seems trivial, constants are often used as base cases or defaults in larger expressions. For instance:

`Light = (Switch AND 1)`

This behaves the same as just `Light = Switch` — because `AND 1` does not change the value of the variable. This is known 
as the identity property, and we’ll explore it further in Lesson 5.

## Boolean Variables

While constants represent fixed values, **boolean variables** are what bring logic expressions to life. A boolean variable is 
a symbol (typically a letter like `A`, `B`, `X`, or `Y`) that can take on one of two values:

* **1 (True)**
* **0 (False)**

Unlike constants, **variables can change** depending on inputs, conditions, or system states. This makes them extremely 
useful for modeling real-world situations, where different conditions might be true at different times.

### Real-World Analogy

Imagine a motion sensor in a room. The sensor’s state — whether motion is detected or not — can be represented by a boolean 
variable, say `MOTION`. If movement is detected, we set `MOTION = 1`; if not, `MOTION = 0`. Now, suppose we also have a 
variable `IS_DARK`, representing whether the room is dark. Using both variables, we could create a logic rule for turning on a light:

`LIGHT = MOTION AND IS_DARK`

This tells us: _only turn the light on when there’s motion in the room **and** it’s dark_ — a clear, real-world condition 
expressed using boolean variables.

In Boolean Algebra, variable names are typically single capital letters, but in real systems (especially in programming), 
we use more descriptive names like `isOnline`, `buttonPressed`, or `hasAccess`.

Here’s a more abstract example:

`X = (A AND B) OR C`

In this expression:

* `A`, `B`, and `C` are Boolean variables.
* Their values might change depending on system input.
* The expression tells us when `X` will be true, based on the values of the other variables.

## Key Takeaways

* Boolean **constants** are fixed values: `1` (True), `0` (False)
* Boolean **variables** are symbols that can represent either `1` or `0` depending on system conditions.
* Variables are used to describe **dynamic logic**, while constants represent **fixed truths or defaults.**
* Boolean expressions are built by combining constants and variables using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).
* These basic elements are used in **real-world systems** like alarm logic, conditional code, and smart devices.
