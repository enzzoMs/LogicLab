Truth tables are one of the most important tools in Boolean Algebra. They let us **see exactly how a logic expression
behaves** under **every possible input condition**. Whether you're designing circuits, writing conditional code, or testing
the accuracy of a logical rule, truth tables provide a clear and complete view of what’s happening. Once you know how
to build and read them, you'll have a major advantage in understanding and simplifying logic.

## Introduction

A **truth table** is a chart that shows every possible combination of input values for a boolean expression and the 
resulting output. It’s like a complete test log that proves how your logic behaves in every scenario.

Each row in a truth table represents one possible set of input values, and the corresponding output is calculated 
based on the logic of the expression. For simple operations like AND or OR, this is straightforward. But even for 
more complex expressions like `(A AND B) OR NOT C`, truth tables allow you to break the logic down **step by step**, 
making errors easier to catch and expressions easier to understand.

You’ll often use truth tables to:

* Predict the output of a logic circuit
* Test whether two expressions are equivalent
* Simplify logic for efficiency
* Teach or verify how logical conditions behave

## What Is a Truth Table?

A **truth table** is a systematic way to display the output of a boolean expression for **all possible 
combinations** of its inputs. It’s a grid that lists:

* Every possible input configuration (using 0s and 1s)
* The resulting output for each configuration

Truth tables are essential in boolean logic because they show **every logical outcome**, leaving no ambiguity. 
They help us understand how logic operations behave — whether individually or in combination.

### Example: A Simple AND Table

Let’s say we want to visualize the expression `A AND B`. We create a truth table like this:

| A | B | A AND B |
| - | - | ------- |
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 1       |

This shows that `A AND B` is only true when **both** inputs are true.

### Why Are Truth Tables Important?

* **Visual Clarity**: You can instantly see how an expression behaves.
* **Debugging Tool**: If a logic circuit or software condition isn't working, a truth table helps you trace the problem.
* **Learning Aid**: They make abstract expressions concrete and easier to understand.
* **Equivalence Checking**: You can use truth tables to compare two expressions and see if they produce the same outputs — proving they’re logically identical.

Whether you’re an engineer building hardware or a beginner writing conditions in code, truth tables give you 
a **complete and reliable view** of logical behavior.

## Constructing Truth Tables

Building a truth table might look intimidating at first, but it follows a clear and logical process. 
The key is to account for **every possible combination** of input values and then compute the output based on the expression.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

Let’s walk through how to construct a truth table from scratch:

1. Count the Variables
    * First, identify how many Boolean variables (like `A`, `B`, `C`, etc.) are in the expression.
    * The number of rows in your table will be `2ⁿ`, where `n` is the number of variables.
      * Example: 2 variables = 4 rows (2²), 3 variables = 8 rows (2³)
2. List All Input Combinations
    * Use binary counting to fill in the values for each variable.
    * Always start with all 0s and go up to all 1s.
3. Evaluate the Expression for Each Row
    * For every input combination, plug the values into the boolean expression.
    * Perform operations in logical order: first NOT, then AND, then OR (similar to operator precedence in math).
4. Write the Output in the Final Column

## Truth Tables for Compound Expressions

While basic operations are straightforward to understand in isolation, real-world logic almost always involves **compound 
expressions** — combinations of multiple operations and variables. Truth tables help us evaluate these expressions 
one step at a time, showing exactly how inputs lead to the final output.

### Example:

The expression `(A AND B) OR C` contains **three variables**: `A`, `B`, and `C`. We'll build a truth table in stages:

1. List all input combinations (since 3 variables → 2³ = 8 rows).
2. Compute intermediate expressions: `A AND B`
3. Use the result of `A AND B` and apply OR with `C`

| A | B | C | A AND B | (A AND B) OR C |
| - | - | - | ------- | -------------- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0       | 0              |
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0       | 1              |
| 0 | 1 | 0 | 0       | 0              |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0       | 1              |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0       | 0              |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0       | 1              |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 1       | 1              |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1       | 1              |

This format shows **each logical step clearly**, helping you trace how the final result is computed.

### Tips for Handling Compound Expressions

* Always **evaluate inner expressions first**, just like parentheses in math.
* Add **intermediate columns** in your truth table to keep track of each logical step.
* Check each row carefully — even one wrong output can break a digital system or introduce a bug in software logic.

## Key Takeaways

* A **truth table** lists all possible combinations of input values and the corresponding output of a Boolean expression.
* The number of rows in a truth table is `2ⁿ`, where `n` is the number of variables.
* Truth tables help you **understand**, **test**, and **verify** logical expressions step-by-step.
* They are widely used in **digital electronics**, **programming**, **logic simplification**, and **AI decision systems**.
* Intermediate steps (like `A OR B`) can be added to a truth table to clarify complex expressions.
